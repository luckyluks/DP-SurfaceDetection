### Time plan
- Concept phase (SW 1-2):
  - Familiarization with hardware (camera-system,PC, etc.) and control-system
  - Literature review for both background subtractionand semantic segmentation
  - Create requirements for both background subtrac-tion and semantic segmentation
  - Set up responsibilities for each group member
  - Installation and study of repositories and libraries
  - Start creating shell code for coming implementa-tion
  - Data  collection and/or setup data pipeline with preprocessing
  - Find suitable existing NN for semantic segmenta-tion (eventual use transfer learning)
  - Image  taking  for  the  background  replacement  tobe executed on and tested with
  - Continuously write and update draft paper
- Design phase (SW 2-4):
  - Software specification for background subtractionand semantic segmentation separately
  - Implementation and ongoing simulation testing ofboth versions
  - Continuously write and update draft paper
- Validation phase (SW 5):
  - Testing  with  physical robots to verify operationsand detect faulty code
  - Conducting requirement validation for each method
  - Continuously write and update draft paper
- Documentation phase (SW 6):
  - Write peer review
  - Getting last feedback on the draft paper
  - Discuss about peer review suggestions and applythem on the draft paper
- Presentation phase (EW):
  - Making last adjustments and finish final paper
  - Attending the fairâˆ—Hand in presentation and final paper
